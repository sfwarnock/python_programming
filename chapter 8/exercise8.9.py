#   Write a program that computes the fuel efficiency of a multi-leg journey.
#   The program will first prompt the for the starting odometer reading and then
#   get information about a series of legs.  For each leg, the user enters the odometer
#   reading and the amount of gas used (separated by a space).  The user signals the end
#   of the trip with a blank line.  The program should print out the miles per gallon
#   achived on each leg and the total MPG for the trip.
